# Philadelphia-Crime-Analysis-Practicum


#### Proposal: 
Classical machine learning models have been applied to predicting crime. However, crime rates generally have a high variance, which is motivation to use a Bayesian analysis to predict and model crime. I am currently using demographic, economic and business data in the analysis, as well as monthly trends such as temperature and precipitation. With this data I am applying standard models (Linear regression, Poisson regression, Decision Tree) and applying different Bayesian structures to each of these base models.
